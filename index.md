## Project Purpose and Components
This project was a further exploration of classes, which also asked students to work on their debugging capabilities.

## What I Learned
It was really fun to do this project, because it reminded me of puzzles (my favorite hobby). It helped me understand classes better, and I felt accomplished when I was able to test and debug my code.
