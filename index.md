## Project Purpose and Components
This project was where students were asked to create their first server and practice using a code module.

## What I Learned
This project marked a really big step in this class. The point of this class was to gain experience with server-side javascript, and up until this point in the term it was something we had been slowly working towards, but had not quite dove into yet. It was really satisfying to do this project and feel like I was creating something. I felt like I had been well prepared by the preceding work, but it was still a nice challenge.
